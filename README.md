# Data_Engineer_test_AFD
It contains the exercises from the questions for the Data Engineer test:

Q1_Cohort_analysis_Jeff.ipynb: Contains the script for the cohort analysis which solves question 1.

Q3_API_Jeff.ipynb: contains the script for the API connection and the update of the DB which solves question 3. It is important to mention that the
API for which the exercise was designed did not work correctly, returning the code 502 Bad Getaway, so I have connected to another free API (for movies), following the same logic of the exercise.

Dockerfile: text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image for the question 4.

docker_compose.yml: The compose for the Q4 Docker. I don't have a docker license so I haven't been able to validate that it works, but it should work.

requirements.txt: Contains the libraries required in Q4.
